//! The startup splash.
//!
//! The reason this is a module of its own: `figlet-rs` and `colored` are the
//! crate's only third-party dependencies, and this is the only file that names
//! them. Clean Architecture's rule about frameworks is that they belong in the
//! outermost ring where they can be deleted without consequence — and here that
//! is literally true. Removing this file removes both dependencies, and nothing
//! in `domain`, `application` or `infrastructure` notices.
