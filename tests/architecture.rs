//! The dependency rule, enforced.
//!
//! Rust modules do **not** enforce acyclicity: `crate::domain` can name
//! `crate::presentation` and the compiler will happily agree. Directory layout
//! alone is therefore a convention, not an architecture — it documents intent
//! and does nothing to preserve it. The only two ways to make the rule real are
//! to split the layers into separate crates in a workspace (Cargo *does* refuse
//! a dependency cycle between crates) or to assert it in a test. This is the
//! second, and it is here because it is far cheaper than the first at this size;
//! `docs/clean_arch.md` records when the workspace becomes worth it.
//!
//! Comment lines are stripped before checking, so a doc link that points outward
//! — `application` referring the reader to `infrastructure::csv::FeedError`, for
//! instance — is prose, not a dependency, and is allowed.
